# Time and Weather Controller

## By Daft Apple Games

# What is it

This is a Time of Day and Weather Controller for Unity. It sits on top of other assets, called "Providers", that actually provide Time of Day and Dynamic Sky functionality. The controller aims to combine the functions of a Time Provider and a Weather Provider, and add some unique touches of it's own, to give developers a single, unified place to control time and weather.

The implementation currently comes with components to support the "Expanse" HDRP asset, and has been developed and tested with Expanse 1.7.3.

# Getting Started

The repository has everything you need to get started. Just put the code into your Assets folder, check the pre-requisites below, and open the demo scene.

## Pre-requisites

To get the demo scenes to work, you'll need to add:

### Third Party Assets

- Expanse (obviously)

### Unity Packages

- Text Mesh Pro
- High Definition RP > Samples > Particle System Shader Samples

# Some Caveats

I am a hobby developer, and have only just started to scratch the surface of Unity and coding. As such, the code presented here may not be the cleanest or the most practical, and I suspect that in many ways I have overcomplicated things! Feedback, and of course PRs, are very welcome!
